# Long Term Support

1. Every LTS release is __actively maintained__ and any __critical bugs fixed__.
   The LTS period is yet to be determined, but will be _at least 12 months_ from the initial LTS release.

2. There are no restrictions on adding new features or enhancements to LTS releases.
3. Even after a release is no longer in LTS, the seneca maintainers will do their _due
   diligence_ and _fix any critical security vulnerabilities_ if they arise.
